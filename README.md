This is my thesis project, it's an Android application that shows different Adroid components that I used (Elements of Material Design, Navigation View with its Navigation Graph 
and Navigation Drawer, Fragments, Google Maps integration inside a Fragment, HTTP request and HTTP response using Volley Library, how to use Picasso to work with photograpies, 
Menu, Navigation Bar 
and much more).
I worked on it completely alone for a month and a half. I'm not an Android expert yet and this project is only a demo. I just started to learn Flutter to make this application 
available for different platforms.
I live with an Open Source mind, so this source code is available for everyone. It's not a perfect work but maybe it can help you. 
I'm available for other advices.
